Operations

In this section, we look at the operations that can be performed on this project and the books of this Book List Management Project. The operations that can be performed by the user are as follows:

Get Books List
Insert a Book
View Book Details
Update Book Details
Delete a Book

In the upcoming sections we will further discuss these operations in detail so that the user can get more clarity of how the web application for this project works.

Get Books List

This operation basically refers to getting the list of all the books we have added to the list. Here there’s a box named Book Lists where we can see all the books that we have in our list. If there isn’t any book in the list then it will not show any books but will present a message as “No books Available” which means that there aren’t any books available to us to see in the list. To see books in this list, we have to add books to this list. We will talk more about adding books to this list in our next operation section.


Insert a Book

In this section, we will talk about how to add a book to our list. To add our books to the list, we have to first click on the blue button named “Insert Book Detail” that is available to us on the top of our application. Here we can enter the details of the book that we want in our list and then if we want to add them to the list, we press “Enter” or click on the button named “Create Book Item” present at the end of the interface. 


View Book Details

In this section we will see how to view the details of the books that we have in the list. To see the details of the books we have in the list we have to just click on the box specifically of that book. By clicking the box we will get an interface which contains all the details specific to the book we clicked.


Update Book Details

In this section we will see how to edit and update the details of a book that is present in our list of books. After performing the operation of “View Book Details” on our book that we want to update, we will click on the specific data detail that we want to edit. By clicking that detail we will get an editing box for that detail. By clicking on the editing box, we can edit that detail as we like. Now if we want to save the updated detail we will click anywhere outside that edit box and it will be saved on its own.


Delete a book

In this section we will see how to delete a specific book available in the books list. For this we have to first perform the operation of “View Book Details” on our book that we want to delete. After getting this interface of the book, we will see a red button named “Delete” on the top right corner. By clicking this delete button, we can delete that specific book permanently from the list.


Conclusion

So, to conclude, we will say that this Book Management List project is basically a project where we can view the list of books added by the user and perform a variety of operations on that list of Books. We can also say that the list of books in this app provides the user an interface that is easy to operate and interact with.

The web application for this project can help users to manage their books as well as to make others familiar with those books present in the books list. This project can also be used as a tool to keep track of all the books one has read or wants to read. Thus, we can say that this project has a lot of utility to the users of this Book Management List project.
